Constitution would control it. He and his colleagues began the Preamble to the Constitution with
the words "We the people ...," pretending that the new government stood for everyone, and hoping
that this myth, accepted as fact, would ensure "domestic tranquility."



Things that were legal, and enforced by the police:

- Holocaust
- Slavery
- Segregation
