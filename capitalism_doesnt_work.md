# Does Capitalism Work?

Lets unpack the idea that "Capitalism works". In the US, the most developed Capitalist country, the richest country in the history of the world:

- [1 out of every 7 US citizens needs to visit food banks to survive](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/17/hunger-study-food/14195585/), despite having enough food to feed [10 billion people.](https://www.oxfam.ca/there-enough-food-feed-world) Half of all food produced is [thrown away by retailers.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect) [Food waste in 2018 enough to feed world's hungry 4 times over.](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/food-waste-enough-feed-world-s-hungry-four-times-over)

[2](http://archive.is/2CvOW). 
- In the US alone, [20-40k deaths every year](http://obamacarefacts.com/facts-on-deaths-due-to-lack-of-health-insurance-in-us/) because of lack of health insurance / care. On average, that's 300k over the last decade.

- Rising Housing prices from real estate speculation have skyrocketed to the point that an epidemic of [hidden homeless](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/los-angeles-hidden-homeless-priced-out-cbsn-originals/) has arisen: families who live in their cars, or on the street, but who still work. In most US cities, such as LA, it's illegal to sleep in your car overnight. 1/3rd of all renters pay half their income towards landlords. Even mid-size cities like Boise Idaho are experiencing a [surge of homelessness as of 2019](https://www.kivitv.com/news/state-of-208/affordable-housing-crisis-leading-to-rise-in-first-time-homelessness-in-boise).

Capitalist hegemony has short-circuited people into buying wildly illogical and ridiculous propaganda like: "*Lift yourselves up by the bootstraps*" (which shows the almost religious power of capitalist propaganda, that the impossible can become possible), or "*Communism doesn't work*", when in fact **Communism did work extremely well.**

Examples from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/86tqdd/but_socialism_doesnt_work_s/dw7qco0/) by /u/bayarea415, [Stephen Gowans - Do publicly owned, planned economies work](https://gowans.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/do-publicly-owned-planned-economies-work/), [Ian Goodrum](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1136693839526223872.html), and [yogthos's USSR acheivements post](https://lemmygrad.ml/post/8636) about the USSR specifically: 

- [USSR had a more nutritious diet than the US, according to the CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84B00274R000300150009-5.pdf). [Calories consumed surpassed the US](https://artir.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/compar1.png?w=640). [source](https://artir.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/the-soviet-union-food/). [Ended famines.](https://artir.wordpress.com/2017/02/04/the-soviet-series-from-farm-to-factory-stalins-industrial-revolution/)
- Productive forces were not organized for capital gain and private enrichment; public ownership of the means of production supplanted private ownership. It was illegal to hire others and accumulate personal wealth from their labor.
- Had the [2nd fastest growing economy of the 20th century after Japan.](https://artir.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/captura-de-pantalla-de-2016-05-26-10-15-23.png) The USSR started out at the same level of economic development and population as Brazil in 1920, which makes comparisons to the US, an already industrialized country by the 1920s, even more spectacular. 
- [Free Universal Health care, and most doctors per capita in the world.]( https://www.marxists.org/archive/newsholme/1933/red-medicine/index.htm ) [42 doctors per 10k population, vs 24 in Denmark and Sweden, 19 in US.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0735675784900482)
- [Had near zero unemployment, continuous economic growth for 70 straight years.](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~syrbe/pubs/FarmtoFactory.pdf) The "continuous" part should make sense – the USSR was a planned, non-market economy, so market crashes á la capitalism were pretty much impossible.
- [USSR moved from 58.5-hour workweeks to 41.6 hour workweeks (-0.36 h/yr) between 1913 and 1960](https://books.google.com/books?id=x8JYjwEACAAJ)

- In 1987, people in the USSR [could retire with pension at 55 (female) and 60 (male) while receiving 50% of their wages at a at minimum.](https://www.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ilo/1994/94B09_66_englp2.pdf) Meanwhile, in USA the average retirement age was 62-67.

- Soviet power production per capita in 1990 was more than [the EU, Great Britain, or China's in 2014.](https://i.imgur.com/7HIm6qi.png)
- Housing was socialized by localized community organizations, and there was virtually no homelessness. Houses were often shared by two families throughout the 20s and 30s – so unlike capitalism, there were no empty houses, but the houses were very full. In the 40s there was the war, and in the 50s there were a number of orphans from the war. The mass housing projects began in the 60s, they were completed in the 70s, and by the 70s, there were homeless people, but they often had genuine issues with mental health.

When it is claimed that a system *works*, we should ask, **who it works for**. Capitalism benefits a tiny number of rapacious capitalists, to the detriment of the rest of us, while Socialism works for the masses.

Now let's take a look at what happens after the USSR collapsed, and what came with capitalist privatization:
