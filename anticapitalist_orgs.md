# Anticapitalist organizations

## What can we do?

Many think that fighting against capitalism feels a lot like throwing pebbles at a tidal wave. How can *I, alone*, do anything to stop all of the [injustices I see being committed?](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md) We see our neighbors being picked up and [deported by ICE](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md#latinos), [police murdering and imprisoning us](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md#black-people), debts that lock us into [indentured servitude](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md#workers-and-the-poor), [global surveillance of every minute detail of our lives](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md#pervasive), endless [wars and imperialism](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md#imperialism), ecological destruction, and [literal slave labor camps](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md#prisoners). Our rents, food costs, and debts are going up, and our [incomes have stagnated.](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/capitalism_doesnt_work.md) The media, and everything around us seems apathetic, complacent, and oblivious. Eight men currently control about half the world's wealth. Their share is growing daily, and will reach a conclusion obvious to anyone who's played monopoly before. With only our labor to sell, and the demand for that labor decreasing, things seem oppressively bleak. 

Here's the thing: **You are not alone**. In fact, **we wage workers are the majority**. The ruling class of [absentee owners](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/crash_course_socialism.md) make up a *tiny minority* of your city's population. Often invisible to us, is the fact that we as wage workers are *surrounded by comrades* who share our same basic interests. Some hold more prejudices than others, but all deserving of a comfortable life. We are impoverished by an *imposed artificial scarcity*, a mal-allocation of the things we need to survive. World food production and housing *already surpasses our needs*, yet [1 out of every 7 US citizens needs to visit food banks to survive.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/17/hunger-study-food/14195585/) In the [UK there are 10x more houses than homeless families.](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/housing-crisis-10-empty-homes-5008151) Our healthcare and other social services, which are ample, are increasingly being privatized. We know that by simply organizing for *human needs rather than private profit*, we can solve our societal problems. We have but to shake off these mooching, leeching, capitalist parasites, like a dog shaking off fleas. 

How do we get there, how do we win? **We join anti-capitalist organizations.**

Capitalists retain their power through the strategy of *divide and conquer.* [Scapegoating hasn't gone out of style;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating) the tactic has always been to blame certain races, sexes, religions, activists, and transform them into demons causing all the world's problems, so people won't point their fingers upwards. The *isolating individualism* enforced by them pervades all aspects of our lives: we often live in isolated housing, we're actively told not to organize or form unions, the news tells us to be afraid of our neighbors... everything ( even human life ) has value only as a unit of *individual consumption.* 

Anti-Capitalist organization always has, and always will be, our only hope, and the only real threat to Capitalist interests. Malcolm X keenly stated that the hand becomes a weapon only when our fingers are **joined together into a fist.** 

Our task is the same as it always has been: to **agitate, educate, organize, and join leftist organizations in our cities.**

Our pessism or optimism is irrelevant: *we have no choice but to organize* for the overthrow of Capitalism; anything less results in a [destruction of the environment and our lives.](https://pics.onsizzle.com/in-this-hour-socialism-is-the-only-salvation-for-humanity-12219484.png) We have no time to waste, capitalists prefer our pacification and death, to our organized resistance. [The police state is here](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md#pervasive), and no amount of [pacifist resistance](https://theredphoenixapl.org/2011/08/11/pacifism-how-to-do-the-enemys-job-for-them/) will threaten it. 

## Notes

Lastly, for thosewho think that broadcasting a list like this ( potentially to our enemies ) harms the cause of anti-capitalism. Remember that: 

- All of these organizations have ( or should have ) vetting processes in place for new members.
- These are all completely legal, *above ground* organizations. Many of them even do armed organizing where it is legal to do so.
- Socialists disdain to conceal our aims; Reactionaries are a vocal minority that are given a loudspeaker by the capitalist media, but workers and those that believe in worker power have always outnumbered them. 

This list is a living document; it will be updated as necessary. Feel free to contact me to add to this, fork this list, or create your own versions.
