| [Bourgeois Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_Marxism) | The name that socialists use to refer to modern representative liberal democracies, criticized as being democracies for the rich only, since representatives and the media in capitalist countries are often the puppets of the capitalists themselves. |

| [The State](https://theimmortalscience.wordpress.com/2017/02/27/the-state-and-revolution-an-overview/) | In Leninism, the state is a *special organization of force* used for the suppression of one class by another.

| [Imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism) | The domination of a weaker country by a stronger one; referring primarily to the conquering and exploitation of labor and natural resources of the weaker country. In Leninism, imperialism is the final stage of capitalism, where finance capital is exported to undeveloped economies, resulting in the colonization and division of the world amongst capitalist monopolies.

| [Nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism) | An ideology which emphasizes nations(and often specific races living in those nations), self-governance, national identity, and patriotism over internationalism.

It also recognizes that the mode of production is the main motive force of history, and contains contradictions (such as class struggle), whose resolution results in the development of new modes of production and social organization. |
| [Labor theory of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value) | A theory of value that argues that the economic value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of average socially necessary labor required to produce it, rather than by the use or pleasure its owner gets from it. |
| [Socialism in one country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_One_Country) | A theory by Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin, that given the failure of the European revolutions of the early 1900s(except in Russia), that the Soviet Union should strengthen itself internally, and postpone world-revolution.

| [Permanent Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_revolution) | In Marxism, the strategy of a revolutionary class to continue to pursue its class interests independently and without compromise, despite overtures for political alliances, and despite the political dominance of opposing sections of society. In Trotskyism, PR holds that the only way to achieve world communism is to allow the revolution to spread unimpeded from nation to nation, the theory that a revolution in one nation would ignite revolutionary fervor worldwide, and that full scale working class revolution must be allowed to germinate. |
| [Right of nations to self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism#National_self-determination) | In Lenin's words: "The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression, and it is this content that we unconditionally support. At the same time, we strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness." In short, its much easier to fight a one front war against local capitalists, than a two front war against much more powerful imperialists. |
| [Democratic Centralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_centralism) | A tenet of Leninism, described by him as, *diversity in discussion, unity in action.* After decisions are reached, they are followed the group. |

| [Alienation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation) | A term used by Marx to denote the estrangement of workers under capitalism from the products of their labor, and themselves; the worker loses the ability to determine life and destiny, when deprived of the right to think of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define their relationships with other people; and to own the things produced by their own labor. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity, this worker is directed by the bourgeoisie, who own the means of production with which they must work to survive. |
| [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution) | In Maoism, the idea that capitalist values do constantly re-appear within the communist party, although not uniformly. It is up to the people, who are the real motive force in world history, to call out and denounce capitalist values and corrupt people in positions of authority, and "bombard the headquarters", to ensure the elimination of bourgeois values and cement proletarian power. |
| [United Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_front) | From Trotskyism, An initiative whereby communists propose to join with all workers belonging to other parties and groups and all unaligned workers in a common struggle to defend the immediate, basic interests of the working class against the bourgeoisie.

| [Transitional Demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_demand) | In Trotskyism, an agitational demand made by a socialist organization with the aim of linking the current situation to progress towards their goal of a socialist society. Transitional demands differ from calls for reform in that they call for things that governments and corporations are unwilling or unable to offer, and therefore, any progress towards obtaining a transitional demand is likely to weaken capitalism and strengthen the hand of the working class. Examples of transitional demands would be "Employment for all" or "Housing for all,"; demands that sound reasonable to the average citizen, but are practically impossible for capitalism to deliver on. |
| [Dual Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_power_(Russian_Revolution)) | A tenet of Leninism, in which two powers, one proletarian(workers councils / direct democratic organizations) and one capitalist(the official state apparatus) coexist and compete for legitimacy, during the transition away from capitalism. |
| [New Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism%E2%80%93Maoism#New_Democracy) | A tenet of Maoism that holds that the national-bourgeois in semi-feudal and semi-colonial countries has a dual character in that although it is an exploitative capitalist force, it can also (though not always) side with the proletariat against colonialism and imperialism. |
| [Protracted Peoples War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism%E2%80%93Maoism#People.27s_War) | In Maoism, a strategy for achieving communism that includes winning the support of the locals(usually the peasantry) in areas away from capitalist strongholds, and waging unconventional guerrilla warfare, while building institutions of dual power to replace capitalist ones. |
| Workers Militia                          | An important focus of Trotskyism, where local, self-organized working-class militias, fighting for their class interests, are the primary vehicle to achieve socialism. |
| **Branches**                             |                                          |
| [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) | A socialist tradition created by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, that places emphasis on the means of production, your relation to them, and the inherent class struggle involved between those who control production, and those who don't. |

Primarily based on the ideas of Kropotkin. |
| [Egoist Anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoist_anarchism) | An individualist school of anarchist thought that originated in the philosophy of Max Stirner, defining an egoist as one who has no political calling, but rather "lives themselves out" without regard to "how well or ill humanity may fare thereby".
