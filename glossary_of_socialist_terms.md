The state decides how to distribute the surplus. Engels argued that the state form would be the final stage of capitalism. State Capitalism could also refer to a capitalist class controlling, or rising above, political power and decision-making.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

All land and productive facilities are controlled by the party. The party may allow limited private ownership, often offering leases in specialized zones, but will not allow a capitalist class to rise above the level of state power or decision-making, as in multi-party bourgeois democracies.                                                                               |

In general terms, a state is any politically organized community under a single government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In Leninism, imperialism is the final stage of capitalism, where finance capital is exported to undeveloped economies, resulting in the colonization and division of the world amongst capitalist monopolies. Geopolitical conflict ensues over this economic exploitation, and the resulting super-profits permit businessmen to bribe native politicians and labor leaders, and intervene militarily to suppress worker revolts.                                                                       |

At the same time, we strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness." In short, its much easier to fight a one front war against local capitalists, than a two front war against much more powerful imperialists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity, this worker is directed by the bourgeoisie, who own the means of production with which they must work to survive.                                             |

| [United Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_front)                                                     | In Trotskyism, an initiative whereby communists propose to join with all workers belonging to other parties and groups and all unaligned workers in a common struggle to defend the immediate, basic interests of the working class against the bourgeoisie. Through united struggle, many workers can be won over to revolutionary socialism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Transitional Demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_demand)                                       | In Trotskyism, an agitational demand made by a socialist organization with the aim of linking the current situation to progress towards their goal of a socialist society. Transitional demands differ from calls for reform in that they call for things that governments and corporations are unwilling or unable to offer, and therefore, any progress towards obtaining a transitional demand is likely to weaken capitalism and strengthen the hand of the working class. Examples of transitional demands would be "Employment for all" or "Housing for all"; demands that sound reasonable to the average citizen, but are practically impossible for capitalism to deliver on. |
| [Dual Power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_power_(Russian_Revolution)>)                                  | A tenet of Leninism, in which two powers, one proletarian (workers' councils / direct democratic organizations) and one capitalist (the official state apparatus) coexist and compete for legitimacy, during the transition away from capitalism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Accelerationists might view our current situation as boiling a frog in water slowly, while a stark uptick in oppression will cause workers to revolt. Few communists support it, because it harms working people, and historically increased oppression hasn't lead to increased chance of revolt. What leads to revolution is actually socialist organization efforts, and a growth in class conciousness.                                                                                                                  |
| [Intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality)                                           | A term that signifies that the various forms of social stratification, such as class, race, sexual orientation, age, religion, creed, disability and gender, do not exist separately from each other but are interwoven together, and must be attacked equally without neglecting any one axis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Important concepts include vanguardism, dictatorship of the proletariat (and how to transition to communism), dual power, the right of nations to self-determination, imperialism, and democratic centralism. The goal of Leninism is the development of a worker state capable of withstanding capitalist encirclement (often called siege socialism), in order to protect and continue the transition to communism, as well as aid other anti-imperialist nations.      |

It involves a call for the independence of social movements from political parties in a revolutionary perspective which seeks to create a practical political alternative to both authoritarian socialism and contemporary representative democracy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Characterized by policies and practices based on the principle that in each country, the means of attaining ultimate communist goals must be dictated by the conditions of that particular country, rather than by a pattern set in another country. During Tito’s era, his ideas specifically meant that the communist goal should be pursued independently of (and often in opposition to) what he referred to as the Stalinist and Imperialist policies of the Soviet Union. |

| [Utopian Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_socialism)                                   | A collection of socialist ideas that predated Marx, namely those of Owen, Fourier, and Saint-Simon. They focus on the presentation of visions and outlines for imaginary or futuristic ideal societies, with positive ideals being the main reason for moving society in such a direction. Later socialists such as Marx and Engels criticized utopian socialism as not being grounded in the material conditions of existing society, and for not identifying the wage-earning class capable of making the transition, and relying on wealthy utopian reformers acting within a capitalist framework.  |
