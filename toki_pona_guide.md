# toki pona guide

## Learning the language

- [jan Lentan's lessons](https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/). By far the best guide for learning the language.
- [jan Misali's 12 days of toki pona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L-dvvng4Zc). Not as good as jan Lentan's lessons, but serves as a speedy introduction to the vocab.

## Vocabulary

- Download a client for the spaced-repetition software, [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
