## Imperialism

### Western hemisphere

- In 1964, [A CIA-backed military coup in Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Brazilian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) overthrows the democratically elected government of [Joao Goulart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Goulart). The junta that replaces it will, in the next two decades, become one of the most bloodthirsty in history. [General Castelo Branco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humberto_de_Alencar_Castelo_Branco) will create Latin America’s first death squads, or bands of secret police who hunt down "communists" and political opponents for torture, interrogation and murder. Later it is revealed that the CIA trains the death squads.

- In the 1962 [Cuban missile crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis), the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and invasion was the only solution, nearly plunging the world into nuclear war. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis)</sup>

- In 1961, in Ecuador, the CIA-backed military forces the democratically elected President [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Velasco_Ibarra] to resign. Vice President Carlos Arosemana replaces him; the CIA fills the now vacant vice presidency with its own man. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Velasco_Ibarra)</sup>

- In 1961, the CIA assassinated [Rafael Trujillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo), a murderous dictator responsible for the deaths of more than 50,000 people, who Washington had supported since 1930. Trujillo’s business interests had grown so large (about 60 percent of the economy) that they had begun competing with American business interests. The US later provided troops on the side of the loyalists in the 1965 [Dominican civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Civil_War), to ensure US interests. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Civil_War)</sup>

- In 1961, he CIA sent 1,500 Cuban exiles to invade Castro’s Cuba in the failed [Bay of Pigs Invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion). B26 bombers attacked cuban airfields, providing initial air support. The planners had imagined that the invasion would spark a popular uprising against Castro -– which never happened. Several hundred were killed in the action. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion)</sup>

- In 1959, following the [US occupation of Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Haiti), The U.S. military helps ["Papa Doc" Duvalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Duvalier) become dictator of Haiti. He creates his own private police force, the [Tonton Macoutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonton_Macoute), who terrorize the population with machetes. They kill over 100,000 during the Duvalier family reign. The U.S. does not protest their dismal human rights record.

- In 1954, the CIA overthrows the democratically elected Guatemalen [Jacobo Árbenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_%C3%81rbenz) in a [military coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). Arbenz threatened to nationalize the Rockefeller-owned United Fruit Company, in which CIA Director Allen Dulles also owns stock. Arbenz is replaced with a series of US-backed right-wing dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years, until 1996. The coup has been described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)</sup>

### Middle East

- From 2000 up to the present day, the US has been carrying out a campaign of drone strikes and asassinations in the Middle East and Africa, including Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths, including women, [children](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush/), and US citizens. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_US_drone_strikes) </sup> Drone strikes are used by the military and the CIA to hunt down and kill people the [Obama administration](https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/KC_Heads01.png) has deemed — through secretive processes, without indictment or trial — worthy of execution. Drone strike targets are usually pinpointed through cell phone usage. This asassination complex is detailed in the [drone papers](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers).

- On 3 October 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130U gunship attacked and killed 42 peopled and wounded 30 more in the [Kunduz Trauma Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike) operated by Doctors Without Borders in the city of Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan. The airstrike constitutes a war crime, as attacks on hospitals are . CNN and the New York Times deliberately obscured the US's responsibility for the bombing, with the headline, "US is blamed after bomb hits afghan hospital". <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike),[2](https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/cnn-and-the-nyt-are-deliberately-obscuring-who-perpetrated-the-afghan-hospital-attack/)</sup>

- On May 9, 2006, U.S. troops executed 3 male Iraqi detainees at the Muthana Chemical Complex, called the [Iron Triangle Murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Iron_Triangle#Iron_Triangle_Murders).<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Iron_Triangle#Iron_Triangle_Murders)</sup>

- On on April 26, 2006 in the [Hamdania incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamdania_incident), US troops killed an unarmed civilian, staging a fake firefight to cover it up. Members of the squad were shooting the stolen AK-47 rifle into the air to make it sound like a firefight was occurring, and after the Iraqi man was dead, the Marines scattered the expended AK-47 brass next to the body, removed the plastic restraints, and placed the AK-47 rifle next to the body.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamdania_incident)</sup>

- On 22 August 2008, A US airstrike killed ~90 civilians, mostly children, in the village of [Azizabad, Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azizabad_airstrike). <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azizabad_airstrike)</sup>

- On July 12, 2007, US AH-64 Apache helicopters bombed and [killed ~15 Iraqi civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike), including two reuters journalists, and wounding two children, in Al-Amin al-Thaniyah, New Baghdad. The attacks received worldwide coverage following the leaking of 39 minutes of classified gunsight footage, in a video released by wikileaks titled collateral murder. 22-year-old American Army intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley Manning) was arrested for leaking the video, along with a video of another airstrike and around 260,000 diplomatic cables, to WikiLeaks. She is still being held in prison under the [Espionage act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917), a law used to jail dissidents, intended to prohibit any interference with military operations. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike)</sup>

- On March 15, 2006, Iraqi civilians were bound and executed by US troops in the [Ishaqi incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishaqi_incident). <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishaqi_incident)</sup>

Many of the torture techniques used were developed at Guantánamo detention centre, including prolonged isolation; sensory deprivation to induce psychosis, a sleep deprivation program whereby people were moved from cell to cell every few hours so they couldn’t sleep for days, weeks, even months, short-shackling in painful positions; nudity; extreme use of heat and cold; the use of loud music and noise and preying on phobias. Many, such as [Manadel al-Jamadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Manadel_al-Jamadi), were tortured to death. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse)</sup>

- On April 14, 2004, Lieutenant Ilario Pantano of the United States Marine Corps, killed two unarmed captives.

- In april, 2004, the US military lied to the family of [Pat Tillman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Tillman), a famous american athlete turned soldier, surrounding his death by friendly fire, and used a fake heroic story about his death as a recruiting poster. The jingoistic media coverage was created by the spin of several top US generals and Bush administration officials, who dictated a memo about how best to handle the embarrassing death of such a high profile soldier. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tillman_Story)</sup>

- The September 11th 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, provoked an international military campaign of middle east imperialism known as [The War on Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror).

Casualty numbers are in the millions, detailed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror#Casualties). <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror)</sup>


### Africa

- In 1965, a CIA-backed military coup installs [Mobutu Sese Seko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko), described as the "archetypal African dictator". The hated and repressive Mobutu exploits his desperately poor country for billions.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko)</sup>

- In 1961, the CIA assists in the assasination of the democratically elected congolese leader [Patrice Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba), throwing the country into years of turmoil. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba)</sup>

### Europe

- In 1967 in Greece, the CIA installed [Georgios Papadopoulos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Papadopoulos), a CIA agent and former nazi collaborator, as the military ruler of Greece. He's seen today as an relic of authoritarianism , xenophobia, and anti-communism. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Papadopoulos)</sup>

- In 1956, Radio Free Europe(a CIA funded propaganda outlet) incites [Hungary to revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956) by broadcasting Khruschev’s Secret Speech, in which he denounced Stalin. It also hints that American aid will help the Hungarians fight. This aid fails to materialize as Hungarians launch a doomed armed revolt, inviting a major Soviet invasion. The conflict kills 7,000 Soviets and 30,000 Hungarians. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956)</sup>

- In 1953, the CIA in Iran overthrows the democratically elected Mohammed Mossadegh in a [military coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat), after he threatened to nationalize British oil. The CIA replaces him with a dictator, the Shah of Iran, whose secret police, [SAVAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK), is as brutal as the Gestapo. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)</sup>

- From 1948 onwards, the CIA under [Allen Dulles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Dulles) developed a program of media manipulation called [Project Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird), having major influence over the media, including >25 newspapers. The usual method was placing reports developed from intelligence provided by the CIA to cooperating or unwitting reporters, or employing media directly as american assets.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird)</sup>

- In 1948, the [CIA corrupts the elections in Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Italy), where Italian communists threaten to win the elections. The CIA buys votes, broadcasts propaganda, threatens and beats up opposition leaders, and infiltrates and disrupts their organizations. The communists are defeated.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_general_election,_1948#Superpower_influence),[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Italy)</sup>

- In 1947, in [Greek civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War) and ensuing [right wing military junta of 1967-74](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967%E2%80%9374), Truman and the CIA provided money and support to anti-communist Greek dictators with deplorable human rights records.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967%E2%80%9374)</sup>

Prisoners held in the camps were designated Disarmed Enemy Forces not POWs, to avoid international treaty regulations. Between 3,000 to 10,000 died from starvation, dehydration and exposure to the weather elements because no structures were built inside the prison compounds. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinwiesenlager)</sup>

- A study by Robert J. Lilly estimates that a total of 14,000 civilian women in England, France and Germany were raped by American GIs during World War II.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes#cite_note-66)</sup>. It is estimated that there were around 3,500 rapes by American servicemen in France between June 1944 and the end of the war and one historian has claimed that sexual violence against women in liberated France was common.<sup>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes#cite_note-bbcNormandy-68)</sup>

- In July, 1945, the predecessor to the CIA, the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS), under the name [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip), rescued and recruited 1,500 Nazi scientists, engineers, and spies.

- In 1965, The [CIA overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Indonesia) the democratically elected Indonesian leader [Sukarno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukarno) with a military coup. The CIA had been trying to eliminate Sukarno since 1957, using everything from attempted assassination to sexual intrigue, for nothing more than his declaring neutrality in the Cold War. His successor, [General Suharto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto), aided by the CIA, massacred between 500,000 to 1 million civilians accused of being communist, in the [Indonesian mass killings of 1965-66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%931966#Foreign_involvement).


- Starting in 1957, in the wake of the US-backed [First Indochina War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Indochina_War), The CIA carries out approximately one coup per year trying to nullify Laos’ democratic elections, specifically targeting the [Pathet Lao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathet_Lao), a leftist group with enough popular support to be a member of any coalition government, and perpetuating the [20 year Laotian civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War). In the late 50s, the CIA even creates an "Armee Clandestine" of Asian mercenaries to attack the Pathet Lao. After the CIA’s army suffers numerous defeats, the U.S. drops more bombs on Laos than all the U.S. bombs dropped in World War II. A quarter of all Laotians will eventually become refugees, many living in caves. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War)</sup>

- In the beginning of the Korean war, US Troops killed ~300 South Korean civilians in the [No Gun Ri massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Gun_Ri_massacre), revealing a theater-wide policy of firing on approaching refugee groups. Trapped refugees began piling up bodies as barricades and tried to dig into the ground to hide. Some managed to escape the first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. No apology has yet been issued. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Gun_Ri_massacre#Killings)</sup> 

- US Troops committed a [number of rapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Japan) during the battle of Okinawa, and the subsequent occupation of Japan. There were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture alone.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Japan)</sup> American Occupation authorities imposed wide-ranging censorship on the Japanese media, including bans on covering many sensitive social issues and serious crimes such as rape committed by members of the Occupation forces.<sup>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Japan#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDower1999412-32)</sup>

- In 1968, the CIA implemented [Operation CHAOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS), a spying program targeting Students for a Democratic Society(SDS), the Black Panthers, the Young Lords, Women Strike for Peace, and Ramparts Magazine, in an effort to tie vietnam anti-war protests to foreign intervention. CIA agents went undercover as student radicals to spy on and disrupt campus organizations protesting the Vietnam War. In total, Operation CHAOS contained files on 7,200 Americans, and a computer index totaling 300,000 civilians and approximately 1,000 groups, with no foreign interventionism found. The operation was halted after the watergate break-in, and exposed a few years later. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS)</sup> 

- In 1953, the CIA begins [Project MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra), a human testing program. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through mind control. MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture. The scope was broad, with research undertaken at 80 institutions, including 44 colleges and universities, as well as hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. Many subjects died under testing, or committed suicide. Others such as [Frank Olson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Olson) were murdered for threatening to expose the program. <sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)</sup>
