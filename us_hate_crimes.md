*Definition: TODO*

### Notes

- Try to convey a sense of moral outrage. 
- This is a living document, it will be updated as new hate crimes pour in.
- These are acts **not committed by figures of authority** directly, those should be included the [List of US atrocities](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md). 
- Feel free to make pull requests(changes), or fork it if you'd like to make your own versions. 
- Name the specific source and recipient for the crime, and provide a source for the claim.
- Try to do chronologically from recent to past; it should seem like a running log.
