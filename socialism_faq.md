Taiwan asked for him to be extradited, but Hong Kong did not have an extradition treaty with Taiwan, so the administration in Hong Kong proposed a bill that would allow Taiwan, the PRC, and Macau to request extradition, which the judiciary in Hong Kong can then approve. [There were 49 crimes that were to be included in the bill that would allow extradition requests.](https://qz.com/1636663/the-37-crimes-included-in-hong-kongs-proposed-extradition-law/) Some of these were financial crimes (Hong Kong is a popular tax haven for billionaires), and the Capitalists in Hong Kong shit themselves because they are often in breach of PRC law, but protected by Hong Kong's independence as a Special Administrative Region. This bill is completely reasonable, and any fears of the PRC taking over or of the extradition of 'political' criminals is unfounded. The US is encouraging the organizers to keep protesting in order to provoke the administration in Hong Kong to crack down on them, so that they can blame China and keep up their propaganda narrative that 'CHINA BAD!'

- [It wasn't a massacre of peaceful students, but a skirmish between PLA soldiers and armed detachments from the pro-capitalist / free market reform movement.](https://www.liberationnews.org/tiananmen-the-massacre-that-wasnt/) The protest movement, as evidenced by their own accounts, called for market liberalisation, and free market reforms, rallying around a replica of the statue of liberty. After the movement had been building in the square for seven weeks, unarmed soldiers were sent in to disperse the protesters, after which many soldiers were beaten to death, torched, and lynched. The New York Times death count went from 2600, to many thousands, to 8000, to tens of thousands. In reality only around ~200 (including soldiers) were killed or trampled, in smaller clashes outside the square. The on-scene New York Times reporter disavowed the article, especially about machine-gunning of protesters. [A wikileaks cable](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8555142/Wikileaks-no-bloodshed-inside-Tiananmen-Square-cables-claim.html) from a US ambassador to the US state department, confirmed that no killings or machine-gunnings took place in the square.

### Whats so bad about Bill Gates?

- [He's a philanthro-capitalist imperialist: using the bill and melinda gates foundation charity as a bargaining chip to work in the interests of billionaire elites.](https://www.liberationnews.org/real-agenda-gates-foundation/) [Youtube Audiobook](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-IkmzWbjoZsjovp13f1xCA-4ewzOdqd) 
  - [Gates spearheads the neoliberal plunder of African Agriculture.](https://theecologist.org/2016/jan/21/gates-foundation-spearheading-neoliberal-plunder-african-agriculture)
  - The Gates foundation tests pharmaceutical products on humans for profit, usually in poorer countries without regulatory bodies. [One such mass test, on behalf of Merck and Pfizer, of a harmful HPV vaccine on 23,000 girls in india kills 7 girls, sterilizes hundreds more, and leads to public outrage.](https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/controversial-vaccine-studies-why-is-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-under-fire-from-critics-in-india/amp_articleshow/41280050.cms) 
  - The Gates foundation helps big pharma find test markets for their drugs, selling them in the global south. This includes drugs such as Gardasil, Norplant, Cervarix. A South African newspaper declared: “We are guinea pigs for the drugmakers.” In the case of Gardasil, the drug-pushing was cloaked in the language of environmentalism, popular empowerment, and feminism. Melinda Gates evoked “choice” in support of her family planning initiatives, but in reality was not poor women, but a handful of the world’s wealthiest people who have presumed to choose which methods of contraception will be delivered, and to whom.
  - [Funnels hundreds of millions in grant money to corporations](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/philanthropy-charity-banga-carnegie-gates-foundation-development), such as Mastercard, Merck, Pfizer, ABC, NBC, Univision, Scholastic, and Pearson.
  - Philanthro-capitalism undermines local communities, dismantling their democracy and autonomy in health care, by making them fully dependent on US billionaires, who are completely unnaccountable.
  - Philanthrocapitalists are currently rushing to take power in a system of global health and population control. Bill Gates warned of “huge population growth in *places where we don’t want it*, like Yemen and Pakistan and parts of Africa.”, echoing  overpopulation fears that have inspired eugenicists since the time of Malthus. Population control is a form of social control, directly targeting the bodies and dignity of poor people, conditioning them to believe that life’s most intimate decisions are outside of their competence and control. 
  - Elite charitable funds are a legal means of **tax avoidance**. Under US law, investments in charitable foundations are tax-free; moreover, investors are not required to sell their stock positions and may continue to vote their shares without restriction. By sheltering foundations, the US Treasury effectively co-finances the activities of Gates foundation and its investors.

  - [During the COVID-19 pandemic, he worked on behalf of big pharma again to protect vaccine intellectual property rights, prioritizing wealthy northern countries over the global south. As of April 2021, fewer than 600 million vaccine doses have been administered around the world; three-quarters of those in just 10 mostly high-income countries. The timeline for supplying poor and middle-income countries with enough vaccines to achieve herd immunity, meanwhile, has been pushed into 2024. These numbers represent more than the “catastrophic moral failure” the director general of the WHO warned about. It is a stark reminder than any policy that obstructs or inhibits vaccine production risks being self-defeating for the rich countries defending exclusive rights and gobbling up the lion’s share of available vaccine supplies.](https://archive.is/9bkpq)

### What's so bad about George Orwell?

- He's antisemitic, homophobic, and racist. Specifically, [he snitched out Jews, Black people, Homosexuals, and communists to British Intelligence.](https://bennorton.com/george-orwell-list-leftists-snitch-british-government/) His list, [here](https://imgur.com/a/k13y8lv), includes him writing:
  - 8 variations of  “Jewish?” (Charlie Chaplin), “Polish Jew, (Tom Driberg)” “English Jew,” or “Jewess.”
  - [Paul Robeson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Robeson) - "ROBESON, Paul (US Negro) ...Very anti-white. [Henry] Wallace supporter."
    - Paul Robeson wasn't anti-white, just look at the welsh coal miners for whom Robeson Campaigned.

  - [George Padmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Padmore), Trinidadian journalist and anti-imperialist campaigner.
- His books Animal Farm and 1984 are used widely as anti-communist propaganda in schools in the US and UK. So much so that [his animated animal farm film was funded by the CIA](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-cia-brought-animal-farm-to-the-screen/). There's a reason they teach George Orwell in schools and not Franz Fanon, Che, Huey P Newton, Malcolm X, Lenin, CLR James, etc. 
- In 1941, illustrator Elias Gertrude approached Orwell, then an editor for the British Ministry of information, with an idea for a satirical cartoon film, portraying the Nazis as pig characters ruling a farm in a kind of dysfunctional fairy story. [He told her that there was not much call for her idea, stole it, changed the name from *A Fairy Story* to *Animal Farm*, and changed the pig-nazis into Communists.](https://www.radnorshire-fine-arts.co.uk/brand/elias-gertrude-1913-1988/)
- [Between 1952 and 1957, from three sites in West Germany, a CIA operation codenamed ‘Aedinosaur’ launched millions of ten-foot balloons carrying copies of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, and dropped them over Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia — whose airforces were ordered to shoot the balloons down.](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/novel-explosives-of-the-cold-war).

At only five feet to his six feet and four inches, Jacintha had shouted, screamed and kicked before running home with a torn skirt and bruised hip. It was "this" rather than any gradual parting of the ways that explains why Jacintha broke off all contact with her childhood friend, never to learn that he had transformed himself into George Orwell."](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/17/georgeorwell.biography)

### What's wrong with Barack Obama?

#### Imperialism

- After winning the Nobel peace prize, he dropped an [average of 30k bombs / year during his presidency, mostly on Muslim countries](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/09/america-dropped-26171-bombs-2016-obama-legacy), [2](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-bombed-iraq-syria-pakistan-afghanistan-libya-yemen-somalia-n704636), [3](https://twitter.com/wallacemick/status/1261744000396152842?s=20). In 2016 alone, dropped [26,171 bombs in the Middle East and North Africa](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html), up 3000 from the previous year. The countries bombed include Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, [Pakistan](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04drones.html?smid=tw-share), Libya, and [Somalia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/03/07/u-s-drone-strike-kills-more-than-150-in-somalia/?utm_term=.fbeafe46df71). 
- Began a campaign of drone assassinations in the Middle East and Africa, in which **90% of those killed were not the intended targets, but [innocent civilian bystanders](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers)**,  including women, [children](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush/), and US citizens. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_US_drone_strikes). Drone strikes are used by the military and the CIA to hunt down and kill people the [Obama administration](https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/KC_Heads01.png) has deemed — through secretive processes, without indictment or trial — worthy of execution. He authorized [10 times more drone strikes](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2017/01/17/obamas-covert-drone-war-numbers-ten-times-strikes-bush/) than George W Bush, [2](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html). The Obama assassination program is detailed in the [drone papers](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers).
- On 3 October 2015, he ordered a United States Air Force AC-130U gunship to attack the [Kunduz Trauma Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike) operated by Doctors Without Borders, in northern Afghanistan. The attack killed 42 people and wounded 30 more. The airstrike constitutes a war crime (attacks on hospitals are considered war crimes), and is the first instance of one Nobel peace prize winner (Obama) bombing and killing another (Doctors without borders). CNN and the New York Times deliberately obscured the US's responsibility for the bombing, with the headline, "US is blamed after bomb hits afghan hospital". [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike),[2](https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/cnn-and-the-nyt-are-deliberately-obscuring-who-perpetrated-the-afghan-hospital-attack/)
- In 2010, President Obama [directed the CIA](http://www.salon.com/2010/04/07/assassinations_2/) to [assassinate an US citizen](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/) in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, despite the fact that he had never been charged with any crime, killing him [with a September, 2011 drone strike](https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/sep/30/anwar-al-awlaki-yemen-live). Two weeks later, a separate CIA drone strike in Yemen [killed his 16-year-old American-born son](http://www.salon.com/2011/10/20/the_killing_of_awlakis_16_year_old_son/), Abdulrahman, along with the boy’s 17-year-old cousin and several other innocent Yemenis. In a predictable display of bipartisanship, in January 2017, Trump ordered a SEAL strike, and reports from Yemen [quickly surfaced](http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-yemen-qaeda-idUKKBN15D094) that 30 people were killed, including 10 women and children. Among the dead: the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar Awlaki, sister of the 16 year old killed by Obama.

[Lobbied to lower Haiti's minimum wage to $0.30 / hour.](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/wikileaks-haiti-let-them-live-3-day/)
- Obama continued backing [Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president who helped the US fight Saddam, giving him $2B every year](https://theintercept.com/2014/10/02/feigned-american-support-egyptian-democracy-lasted-roughly-six-weeks/). After Mubarak was exposed for corruption in the 2009 Arab Spring, the US entered talks with [Suleiman, a CIA collaborator and Mubarak's vice president intelligence chief known for torturing people on behalf of the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Suleiman) The US then granted him asylum and medical treatment.
- Obama continued support for Israel and their genocide of Palestineans, leaving a parting gift of his presidency to Israel of [$38B in military aid over the next 10 years.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-statement-idUSKCN11K2CI) “Prime Minister Netanyahu and I are confident that the new MOU will make a significant contribution to Israel’s security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood,” Obama wrote.
- Finally acheived the US goal of overthrowing Gaddafi and destabilizing Libya. From 2011 onward, began conducting an extensive bombing campaign (>110 tomahawk cruise missiles) in the [Libyan Civil Wars of 2011 and 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)). This includes 7,700 air strikes, resulting in 30,000 -100,000 deaths. Loyalist towns were bombed to rubble and ethnically cleansed, and the country is in chaos as Western-trained and armed Islamist militias seize territory and oil facilities and vie for power. The Misrata militia, trained and armed by Western special forces, is one of the most violent and powerful in the world.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)) The country has since collapsed into a chaos of child soldiers, slavery, and violence between extremist groups, a haunting repetition of what US imperialism has left in its wake in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. [An interview with Gaddafi's former spokesman about the US overthrow of Libya.](https://www.rt.com/news/470321-libya-gaddafi-spokesman-interview/) When pressured, Obama stated that "not managing the aftermath of overthrowing Gaddafi" was ["the greatest mistake of his presidency."](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/barack-obama-says-libya-was-worst-mistake-of-his-presidency)
- In 2009, [Obama and Hillary Clinton assisted in the military coup of democratically elected leftist leader Zelaya of Honduras, who the US saw as a threat to US business interests](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/03/15/us-role-honduras-coup-and-subsequent-violence), [2](.https://theintercept.com/2015/07/06/clinton-honduras-coup/). [Leaked emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2157083-peanut-gallery.html) found that [Hillary was brokering a deal with the coup leaders, to ensure Zelaya would be prevented from returning to power](https://theintercept.com/2015/07/06/clinton-honduras-coup/), and Obama [blocked a proposed resolution requiring Zelaya's return](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras/pressure-mounts-on-honduras-to-end-coup-crisis-idUSN287369520090929). After the coup, at least [116 anti-US environmental activists have been murdered by the pro-US regime.](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/how-many-more/) [2](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-clinton-backed-honduran-regime-is-picking-off-indigenous-leaders/) The US now faces [massive immigration from the very same countries it destabilized](https://theconversation.com/how-us-policy-in-honduras-set-the-stage-for-todays-migration-65935), then deports them in a never-ending cycle of oppression.

#### Empowering Finance Capital

- [A leaked email revealed that the US bank Citigroup hand-picked Obama's cabinet](https://observer.com/2016/10/obama-makes-first-appearance-in-wikileaks-receives-admin-list-from-big-banker/), [2](https://twitter.com/eshaLegal/status/943235896840785925?s=20), in 2008, at the beginning of the financial crisis. 
  - Refused to prosecute any bankers or executives responsible for the 2008 crisis. His attorney general stated, ["Some banks are just too big to prosecute."](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eric-holder-banks-too-big_n_2821741)

[He approves a 117M ton expansion of coal production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlmT_UVxKNI), outraging climate activists.
- Obama went back on his campaign promise for a single-payer health care system, and removed the public option from his ACA ( a proposal mostly taken from Mitt Romney, and written by health-care industry moguls), which granted massive subsidies to empower the parasitic health insurance industry ( [~1.2 Trillion USD](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-industry-overview) ), forcing those unable to afford insurance to pay a $700 yearly fee for not having it ( called the ["shared responsibility provision"](https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/individual-shared-responsibility-provision/) ). His ACA is essentially a huge govt subsidy directly into the pockets of private health companies along with a mandate that forced people to pay these companies as well.  At least [1/4th of US workers are trapped in the gig economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/gig-economy-us-trump-uber-california-robert-reich), and many more are employed at less than full-time hours without insurance.
- [Did nothing about ballooning student loan debt ( now > $1T, an 86% increase during his tenure ), refusing to institute forgiveness programs, or allowing student loans to be discharged through bankruptcy.](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/279512-president-obamas-horrible-terrible-legacy-on-student-loans) Obama federalized the system to where the government now profits immensely from both interest on loans it makes directly to students, and defaults. [Outsourced federal student loan debt collections to private loan firms for a huge profit.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/08/debt-student-loan-forgiveness-betsy-devos-education-department-fedloan/) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/business/once-a-student-now-dogged-by-collection-agencies.html)
- Presided over the [largest foreclosure crisis in US history](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foreclosed.pdf), did nothing about it.
- The Obama era was one of the greatest decreases in working class and [black wealth](https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality), [2](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foreclosed.pdf) in history: home equity decreased by ~$17k between 2007 and 2016. His housing policies led to millions losing their homes. While Wall street banks recieved $29 Trillion in bailouts, $75 Billion in relief was set aside for housing foreclosures and mortgage assistance. Instead of being paid to families, this was paid to mortgage servicers, and the services found ways to pocket the money and continue foreclosures: by the end of the program, less than 20% of the funds were used, and most had dropped out of the program due to foreclosures. The Obama administration refused to prosecute the fraud, or any of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis.
- [Visited Flint Michigan during their lead-water poisoning crisis, to support the governor's non-response, and do damage control for the democratic party, outraging citizens.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GVv3n18_TGs) Refused to give federal aid to the city, or call a state of emergency. In a highly offensive gesture during a town hall meeting, he made light of the situation by pretending to drink the poisoned tap water. Eventually authorized FEMA to give a pithy $5M to the city, while estimates suggested that at least $100M is needed. 100k citizens, including 8-10k children have lead poisoning as a result of the state's negligence.

[His net-worth increased 3000% post-presidency.](https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-michelle-obama-net-worth-2018-7) 

#### Mass Imprisonment

- [Deported over 3M immigrants during his presidency](https://www.axios.com/immigration-ice-deportation-trump-obama-a72a0a44-540d-46bc-a671-cd65cf72f4b1.html), [2](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/biden-immigration-2020-1411691) [Deported over 400k people in 2012 alone.](https://i.imgur.com/mko2Hm6.png) Helped grow ICE, and the US mass immigrant detention system. 
  - In the present day, [ICE (U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement#Case_samples), the police tasked with immigration enforcement, operates over 500 prison camps, holding over 34,000 undocumented people deemed "aliens", 20,000 of which have no criminal convictions, in the US [system of immigration detention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States#Criticisms). [The camps](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/opinions/reyes-immigration-detention/) include forced labor (often with [contracts from private companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement#Corporate_contracts)), poor conditions, lack of rights (since the undocumented aren't considered citizens), and forced deportations, often splitting up families. Detainees are often held for a year without trial, with antiquated court procedures pushing back court dates for months, encouraging many to accept immediate deportation in the hopes of being able to return faster than the court can reach a decision, but forfeiting legal status, in a cruel system of coercion. After the creation of DHS and ICE, the budget for immigration enforcement doubled from [$6.2 billion in 2002 to $12.5 billion in 2006 under Obama.](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-enforcement-united-states-rise-formidable-machinery) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States#Criticisms), [2](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/opinions/reyes-immigration-detention/),[3](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-enforcement-united-states-rise-formidable-machinery)

- Scaled up the war on drugs, imprisoning minorities at far greater rates than ever historically. Gave no support to Black lives matter, the Ferguson protests, or the dakota access pipeline protests, allowing local authorities to brutally repress these movements.
  - The [War On Drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs), a policy of arrest and imprisonment targeting minorities, first initiated by Nixon, has over the years created a monstrous system of mass incarceration, resulting in the imprisonment of 1.5 million people each year, with the US having the most prisoners per capita of any nation. One in five black Americans will spend time behind bars due to drug laws. The war has created a permanent underclass of impoverished people who have few educational or job opportunities as a result of being punished for drug offenses, in a vicious cycle of oppression.

  - [Obama authorizes the use of Military equipment for police.](https://www.mintpressnews.com/white-house-reauthorize-military-equipment-police/218714/)
  - Massively grew the US [prison–industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex), and the [rapid expansion of the US inmate population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate#Growth) to the political influence of [private prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison) companies and businesses that supply goods and services to government prison agencies. Such groups include corporations that contract [prison labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_labor), construction companies, [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance) technology vendors, companies that operate prison food services and medical facilities, [private probation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_probation) companies, lawyers, and [lobby groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobby_groups) that represent them. Activist groups such as the [National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_the_Reform_of_Marijuana_Laws) (NORML) have argued that the prison-industrial complex is perpetuating a flawed belief that imprisonment is an effective solution to social problems such as [homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness), [unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment), [drug addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_addiction), [mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness), and [illiteracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiteracy). [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex)
  - On April 12, 2015, [Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Freddie_Gray), a 25-year-old [Black man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_American), was [arrested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested) by the [Baltimore Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Police_Department) for possessing what the police alleged was an illegal [switchblade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade) under Baltimore law. While being transported in a [police van](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_van), several cops held him down, putting pressure on his spinal cord, after which he fell into a [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma) and died, sparking a series of [protests in Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Baltimore_protests); riot police responded violently, and called in the national guard to aid against the "thugs", as they were labeled by [Obama in a press conference](https://youtu.be/ml1LzRenH_Q). After the protests were put down, the police officers were given separate trials, and all of them were found innocent. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Freddie_Gray)

#### Mass surveillance

- [Obama authorized the massive, behind-closed-doors growth of the worldwide US surveillance system.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present))
  - Since 2012, the US military has a [state-run and funded astroturfing campaign](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) to manipulate public opinion online, and spread pro-US propaganda through government funded sockpuppets, called [Operation Earnest Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice).
  - The 2010 [US diplomatic cables leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak) by Chelsea Manning revealed a pervasive policy of using US ambassadors as spies, supporting dictatorships, spying on the UN, strong-arming for US companies abroad, and disrupting nuclear disarmament talks. The scope of these leaks touches every country the US has a relationship with, and they are better detailed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contents_of_the_United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak).

  - In 2010, [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning) was imprisoned under the espionage act for a series of leaks which embarrassed the US government, including the [July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike), [Afghan War documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_War_documents_leak), [Iraq War documents leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak), [US diplomatic cables leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak), and the [Guantanamo Bay files leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_files_leak).

- [Ruled against the Oneida tribe over a dispute regarding its territorial claim, her majority opinion stating: "We hold that the tribe cannot unilaterally revive its ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue."](https://michaelleroyoberg.com/uncategorized/on-the-notorious-rbg-and-sherrill/) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Sherrill_v._Oneida_Indian_Nation_of_New_York)
- [In Navajo Nation v. United States Forest Service, she ruled against the Navajo nation, who have consistently protested US encroachment of a US forest-service run ski resort on Navajo territory known as the sacred San Francisco Peaks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Nation_v._United_States_Forest_Service)
- [In Inyo County v. Paiute-Shoshone Indians, the Paiute tribe asserted that it was against their privacy policy to allow Inyo county district attorneys to investigate their employees. They stated that their tribe's status as a sovereign nation made them immune to state processes under federal law and asserted that the state authorized the seizure of tribal records. RBG concurred with the supreme court in dismissing their complaint suit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inyo_County_v._Paiute-Shoshone_Indians_of_the_Bishop_Community)
- [In Salazar_v. Ramah_Navajo Chapter, the issue in question was whether the US government, when it enters into a contract with a Native American (Indian) tribe for services, must pay contracts in full, even if Congress has not appropriated enough money to pay all tribal contractors. In a 5-4 decision, Ginsburg sided with the minority that stated the government shouldn't have to pay.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salazar_v._Ramah_Navajo_Chapter)
- [In Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, the supreme court unanimously ruled against the Navajo nation that charged a hotel occupancy tax for providing services (police, fire, and ambulances) for fee land (non-indian territory within indian territory). The court ruled that the tribe's imposition of a tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within the reservation was presumptively invalid without establishing that the tax was related to a consensual relationship with Atkinson.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Trading_Co._v._Shirley)
- [In Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Ginsburg dissented with the majority, who ruled that an Indian Nation were entitled to sovereign immunity from contract lawsuits, whether made on or off reservation, or involving governmental or commercial activities.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiowa_Tribe_of_Oklahoma_v._Manufacturing_Technologies,_Inc.)
- [In Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, the supreme court unanimously ruled against a tribal council who wanted to collect a tax from non-tribal members doing business on tribal lands. The Court decided unanimously that the land was not the tribe's land subject to the tribal tax, even though it was owned by the tribe, because it was not part of a Native American reservation. Because all but one reservation in Alaska (the Annette Island reservation of the Tsimshian) had been eliminated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, the decision had the practical effect of prohibiting almost all Indian tribes in Alaska from collecting taxes for activities conducted on tribal land. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_v._Native_Village_of_Venetie_Tribal_Government)
- [In C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band, Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, Ginsburg in her unanimous court opinion stated that: "An Indian tribe has sovereignty and is immune from suit in a state court unless that immunity has been specifically abrogated by the United States Congress or clearly waived by the tribe. In this case, the Potawatomie Tribe entered into a contract, using a contract form that the tribe provided, that agreed to arbitration and to having the dispute heard in state court. This is a clear waiver of the tribe's sovereign immunity."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%26_L_Enterprises,_Inc._v._Citizen_Band,_Potawatomi_Indian_Tribe_of_Oklahoma)

- [RBG hired 1 POC staffer in 25 years. Kavanaugh, a conservative justice, has 25% POC out of his 48 law clerks. One writer noted that Kavanaughs views on affirmative action don't reflect his diverse hiring practices, while Ginsburg's progressive views don't extend to her chambers. This is an improvement from her 13-year tenure on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, when Ginsburg never had any black clerks. When this issue was raised during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1993, Ginsburg said: “If you confirm me for this job, my attractiveness to black candidates is going to improve.” That promise was ignored.](https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/ruth-bader-ginsburg-can-learn-from-justice-kavanaugh) [2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-bader-ginsburg-can-learn-something-from-brett-kavanaugh/2018/10/15/b8974a86-cd77-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html)
- [Her best friend on the court was the most racist, conservative justice in modern times, Scalia.](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/03/the-rise-of-the-ruth-bader-ginsburg-cult) In the fawning book *Notorious RBG*, one of the few mentions of race is in the book’s discussion of Bush v. Gore, the contentious decision that decided the 2000 presidential election. The authors mention that Ginsburg’s draft of her dissent had a footnote alluding to the possible suppression of Black voters in Florida. Justice Scalia responded to this draft by flying into a rage, telling Ginsburg that she was using “Al Sharpton tactics.” Ginsburg removed the footnote before it saw the light of day. This anecdote’s inclusion in the book is baffling, as Ginsburg contemplates calling anti-Black racism in the most facile of ways. But when her friend Justice Scalia plucks an argument straight from right-wing talk radio to shame her out of doing so, Ginsburg instantly capitulates. Scalia called the Voting rights act ["racial entitlement"](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-voting-rights-scalia-sees-a-racial-entitlement), opposed women's rights, and consistently defended anti-gay measures, yet these views did not stop her calling Scalia her ["best buddy" on the court, their families even spending every new year together.](https://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10990156/scalia-ginsburg-friends) 

#### Law and Order

- [In Brogan v United States, ruled that due process does not apply to those being questioned by law enforcement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogan_v._United_States)
- [In Kansas v. Carr, the Kansas Supreme Court had overturned a pair of death sentences, on the grounds that the defendants’ Eighth Amendment rights had been violated in the instructions given to the jury. The U.S. Supreme swooped in, informing Kansas that it had made a mistake; nobody’s Eighth Amendment rights had been violated, thus the defendants ought to have continued unimpeded along the path toward execution. The Court’s decision was 8-1, with Ginsburg putting her name on Justice Scalia’s majority opinion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_v._Carr)
- [In Samson v. California, she went against the other liberal judges, on the issue of whether police could conduct warrantless searches of parolees merely because they were on parole. She sided with the police.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_v._California)
- [In Heien v. North Carolina, Ginsburg held that the police may justifiably pull over cars if they believe they are violating the law, even if the police are misunderstanding the law, so long as the mistake was reasonable.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heien_v._North_Carolina)
- [In Plumhoff v. Rickard, she concurred with the court that held that the family of two men could not sue the police after they had shot and killed them for fleeing a police stop.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumhoff_v._Rickard)
- [In Taylor v. Barkes, she concurred with the Court that held that the family of a suicidal man who was jailed and then killed himself could not sue the jail for failing to implement anti-suicide measures.](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/taylor-v-barkes/)
- [In Nieves v Bartlett, agreed that cops should be protected from lawsuits as long as they cite probable cause in the original arrest.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieves_v._Bartlett)
- [In Scott v. Harris, a high-speed chase involved a motorist being paralyzed after the cop ran his car off the road. Since the motorist had no charges or suspicion, the court was asked to decide whether the chase consititued unreasonable search and seizure, and whether running a car off the road constitutes deadly force that should be liable to lawsuits. Justice John Paul Stevens, the lone dissenter, argued that the videotape evidence was not decisive, as the majority claimed it to be, and that a jury should determine if deadly force was justified. He stated a jury should be used, instead of the case "being decided by a group of elderly appellate judges"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_v._Harris)
- [As a law and order liberal, she consistently stands with police against outspoken Justice Sotomayer.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/11/sonia-sotomayor-dissents-in-mullenix-police-shooting-case.html)
