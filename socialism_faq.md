### What about the Hong Kong protests?

- The extradition bill came about when a [man from Hong Kong killed his pregnant girlfriend while in holiday in Taiwan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/c1nxga/opinions_on_hong_kong_protests/ered9wl/) He fled back to Hong Kong. Taiwan asked for him to be extradited, but Hong Kong did not have an extradition treaty with Taiwan, so the administration in Hong Kong proposed a bill that would allow Taiwan, the PRC, and Macau to request extradition, which the judiciary in Hong Kong can then approve. [There were 49 crimes that were to be included in the bill that would allow extradition requests.](https://qz.com/1636663/the-37-crimes-included-in-hong-kongs-proposed-extradition-law/) Some of these were financial crimes, and the Bourgeoisie in Hong Kong shit themselves because they are often in breach of PRC law, but protected by Hong Kong's independence as a Special Administrative Region. This bill is completely reasonable, and any fears of the PRC taking over or of the extradition of 'political' criminals is unfounded. Right now I fear that the US is encouraging the organizers to keep protesting in order to provoke the administration in Hong Kong to crack down on them, so that they can blame China and keep up their propaganda narrative that 'CHINA BAD!'

### What about the Tiananmen square massacre?

- [Tiananmen Square "Massacre", A Propaganda Hoax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6RT_s1T050)
- [It wasn't a massacre of peaceful students, but a skirmish between PLA soldiers and armed detachments from the pro-capitalist / free market reform movement.]( https://www.liberationnews.org/tiananmen-the-massacre-that-wasnt/) The protest movement, as evidenced by their own accounts, called for market liberalisation, and free market reforms, rallying around a replica of the statue of liberty. After the movement had been building in the square for seven weeks, unarmed soldiers were sent in to disperse the protesters, after which many soldiers were beaten to death, torched, and lynched. The New York Times death count went from 2600, to many thousands, to 8000, to tens of thousands. In reality only around ~200 (including soldiers) were killed or trampled, in smaller clashes outside the square. The on-scene New York Times reporter disavowed the article, especially about machine-gunning of protesters. [A wikileaks cable](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8555142/Wikileaks-no-bloodshed-inside-Tiananmen-Square-cables-claim.html) from a US ambassador to the US state department, confirmed that no killings or machine-gunnings took place in the square.

### Whats so bad about Bill Gates?
- [He's a philanthro-capitalist imperialist: using the bill and melinda gates foundation charity as a bargaining chip to work in the interests of billionaire elites.](https://www.liberationnews.org/real-agenda-gates-foundation/) [Youtube Audiobook](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-IkmzWbjoZsjovp13f1xCA-4ewzOdqd) 
  - The Gates foundation tests pharmaceutical products on humans for profit, usually in poorer countries without regulatory bodies. [One such mass test, on behalf of Merck and Pfizer, of a harmful HPV vaccine on 23,000 girls in india kills 7 girls, sterilizes hundreds more, and leads to public outrage.](https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/controversial-vaccine-studies-why-is-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-under-fire-from-critics-in-india/amp_articleshow/41280050.cms) 
  - The Gates foundation helps big pharma find new markets for drugs deemed unfit for westerners, selling them in the global south. This includes harmful drugs such as Gardasil, Norplant, Cervarix. A South African newspaper declared: “We are guinea pigs for the drugmakers.” In the case of Gardasil, the drug-pushing was cloaked in the language of environmentalism, popular empowerment, and feminism. Melinda Gates evoked “choice” in support of her family planning initiatives, but in reality was not poor women, but a handful of the world’s wealthiest people who have presumed to choose which methods of contraception will be delivered, and to whom.
  - [Funnels hundreds of millions in grant money to corporations](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/philanthropy-charity-banga-carnegie-gates-foundation-development), such as Mastercard, Merck, Pfizer, ABC, NBC, Univision, Scholastic, and Pearson.
  - Philanthro-capitalism undermines local communities, dismantling their democracy and autonomy in health care, by making them fully dependent on US billionaires, who are completely unnaccountable.
  - Philanthrocapitalists are currently rushing to take power in a system of global health and population control. Bill Gates warned of “huge population growth in *places where we don’t want it*, like Yemen and Pakistan and parts of Africa.”, echoing  overpopulation fears that have inspired eugenicists since the time of Malthus. Population control is a form of social control, directly targeting the bodies and dignity of poor people, conditioning them to believe that life’s most intimate decisions are outside of their competence and control. 
  - Elite charitable funds are a legal means of **tax avoidance**. Under US law, investments in charitable foundations are tax-free; moreover, investors are not required to sell their stock positions and may continue to vote their shares without restriction. By sheltering foundations, the US Treasury effectively co-finances the activities of Gates foundation and its investors.

### What's so bad about George Orwell?
- He's antisemitic, homophobic, and racist. Specifically, [he snitched out Jews, Black people, Homosexuals, and communists to British Intelligence.](https://bennorton.com/george-orwell-list-leftists-snitch-british-government/) His list includes him writing:
  - 8 variations of  “Jewish?” (Charlie Chaplin), “Polish Jew, (Tom Driberg)” “English Jew,” or “Jewess.”
  - [Paul Robeson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Robeson) - "ROBESON, Paul (US Negro) ...Very anti-white. [Henry] Wallace supporter."
    - Paul Robeson wasn't anti-white, just look at the welsh coal miners for whom Robeson Campaigned.
    - [Relevant testimony of Paul Robeson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmFjjaFNHKo) to the House of Unamerican activities committee during the red scare.

  - [George Padmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Padmore), Trinidadian journalist and anti-imperialist campaigner.
- His books Animal Farm and 1984 are used widely as anti-communist propaganda in schools in the US and UK. So much so that [his animated animal farm film was funded by the CIA](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-cia-brought-animal-farm-to-the-screen/).  There's a reason they teach George Orwell in schools and not Franz Fanon, Che, Huey P Newton, Malcolm X, Lenin, CLR James, etc. 
- [Orwell worked as a British imperial cop in Burma for 5 years](http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Myanmar/sub5_5e/entry-3083.html).

- Hidden beneath a superficial rationalism, they provide a seemingly intellectual [defense of imperialism](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/12/new-atheism-old-empire/), push islamophobia, and use it to create a smokescreen for the injustices of global capitalism.
