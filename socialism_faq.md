### What about the Hong Kong protests?

Taiwan asked for him to be extradited, but Hong Kong did not have an extradition treaty with Taiwan, so the administration in Hong Kong proposed a bill that would allow Taiwan, the PRC, and Macau to request extradition, which the judiciary in Hong Kong can then approve. [There were 49 crimes that were to be included in the bill that would allow extradition requests.](https://qz.com/1636663/the-37-crimes-included-in-hong-kongs-proposed-extradition-law/) Some of these were financial crimes (Hong Kong is a popular tax haven for billionaires), and the Capitalists in Hong Kong shit themselves because they are often in breach of PRC law, but protected by Hong Kong's independence as a Special Administrative Region. This bill is completely reasonable, and any fears of the PRC taking over or of the extradition of 'political' criminals is unfounded. The US is encouraging the organizers to keep protesting in order to provoke the administration in Hong Kong to crack down on them, so that they can blame China and keep up their propaganda narrative that 'CHINA BAD!'

- [It wasn't a massacre of peaceful students, but a skirmish between PLA soldiers and armed detachments from the pro-capitalist / free market reform movement.]( https://www.liberationnews.org/tiananmen-the-massacre-that-wasnt/) The protest movement, as evidenced by their own accounts, called for market liberalisation, and free market reforms, rallying around a replica of the statue of liberty. After the movement had been building in the square for seven weeks, unarmed soldiers were sent in to disperse the protesters, after which many soldiers were beaten to death, torched, and lynched. The New York Times death count went from 2600, to many thousands, to 8000, to tens of thousands. In reality only around ~200 (including soldiers) were killed or trampled, in smaller clashes outside the square. The on-scene New York Times reporter disavowed the article, especially about machine-gunning of protesters. [A wikileaks cable](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8555142/Wikileaks-no-bloodshed-inside-Tiananmen-Square-cables-claim.html) from a US ambassador to the US state department, confirmed that no killings or machine-gunnings took place in the square.

- As a PR stunt, Musk promised to build a mini-submarine to rescue a boys soccer team that got trapped in a Thai cave in 2018.

Musk's team then told the investigator: “We would like you to immediately move forward with ‘leaking’ this information to the UK press. Obviously must be done very carefully.” [Musk and his team even lobbied the Thai gov and prime minister to get a local official to reverse a statement saying the mini-submarine wasn't practical, before the children had been rescued.](https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1181396377605029888)

### Whats so bad about Bill Gates?

- [He's a philanthro-capitalist imperialist: using the bill and melinda gates foundation charity as a bargaining chip to work in the interests of billionaire elites.](https://www.liberationnews.org/real-agenda-gates-foundation/) [Youtube Audiobook](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-IkmzWbjoZsjovp13f1xCA-4ewzOdqd) 
  - The Gates foundation tests pharmaceutical products on humans for profit, usually in poorer countries without regulatory bodies. [One such mass test, on behalf of Merck and Pfizer, of a harmful HPV vaccine on 23,000 girls in india kills 7 girls, sterilizes hundreds more, and leads to public outrage.](https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/controversial-vaccine-studies-why-is-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-under-fire-from-critics-in-india/amp_articleshow/41280050.cms) 
  - The Gates foundation helps big pharma find test markets for their drugs, selling them in the global south. This includes drugs such as Gardasil, Norplant, Cervarix. A South African newspaper declared: “We are guinea pigs for the drugmakers.” In the case of Gardasil, the drug-pushing was cloaked in the language of environmentalism, popular empowerment, and feminism. Melinda Gates evoked “choice” in support of her family planning initiatives, but in reality was not poor women, but a handful of the world’s wealthiest people who have presumed to choose which methods of contraception will be delivered, and to whom.
  - [Funnels hundreds of millions in grant money to corporations](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/philanthropy-charity-banga-carnegie-gates-foundation-development), such as Mastercard, Merck, Pfizer, ABC, NBC, Univision, Scholastic, and Pearson.
  - Philanthro-capitalism undermines local communities, dismantling their democracy and autonomy in health care, by making them fully dependent on US billionaires, who are completely unnaccountable.
  - Philanthrocapitalists are currently rushing to take power in a system of global health and population control. Bill Gates warned of “huge population growth in *places where we don’t want it*, like Yemen and Pakistan and parts of Africa.”, echoing  overpopulation fears that have inspired eugenicists since the time of Malthus. Population control is a form of social control, directly targeting the bodies and dignity of poor people, conditioning them to believe that life’s most intimate decisions are outside of their competence and control. 
  - Elite charitable funds are a legal means of **tax avoidance**. Under US law, investments in charitable foundations are tax-free; moreover, investors are not required to sell their stock positions and may continue to vote their shares without restriction. By sheltering foundations, the US Treasury effectively co-finances the activities of Gates foundation and its investors.

- Despite the myth of his "humble origins", and a "rags to riches" story, [his mother served on the board of directors for many corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Maxwell_Gates), and comes from a wealthy banking family. His father was a [wealthy corporate lawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Gates_%26_Ellis), and co-owner of the law firm Preston, Gates & Ellis. The family owned a summer lake house on Puget Sound, and sent their son to the [most prestigious, private high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeside_School_(Seattle%29) in Washington state, where he met fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

### What's so bad about George Orwell?

- He's antisemitic, homophobic, and racist. Specifically, [he snitched out Jews, Black people, Homosexuals, and communists to British Intelligence.](https://bennorton.com/george-orwell-list-leftists-snitch-british-government/) His list includes him writing:
  - 8 variations of  “Jewish?” (Charlie Chaplin), “Polish Jew, (Tom Driberg)” “English Jew,” or “Jewess.”
  - [Paul Robeson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Robeson) - "ROBESON, Paul (US Negro) ...Very anti-white. [Henry] Wallace supporter."
    - Paul Robeson wasn't anti-white, just look at the welsh coal miners for whom Robeson Campaigned.
    - [The testimony of Paul Robeson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmFjjaFNHKo) (one of the people Orwell snitched on), to HUAC (House of Unamerican activities committee) during the red scare.
  - [Stephen Spender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Spender)  - "Sentimental sympathiser... Tendency towards homosexuality" 
  - [Hugh MacDiarmid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_MacDiarmid), Scottish nationalist poet, and anti-imperialist. 
  - [George Padmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Padmore), Trinidadian journalist and anti-imperialist campaigner.
- His books Animal Farm and 1984 are used widely as anti-communist propaganda in schools in the US and UK. So much so that [his animated animal farm film was funded by the CIA](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-cia-brought-animal-farm-to-the-screen/).  There's a reason they teach George Orwell in schools and not Franz Fanon, Che, Huey P Newton, Malcolm X, Lenin, CLR James, etc.

### What's wrong with Barack Obama?

#### Imperialism

- After winning the Nobel peace prize, he dropped an [average of 30k bombs / year during his presidency, mostly on Muslim countries](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/09/america-dropped-26171-bombs-2016-obama-legacy), [2](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-bombed-iraq-syria-pakistan-afghanistan-libya-yemen-somalia-n704636), [3](https://twitter.com/wallacemick/status/1261744000396152842?s=20). In 2016 alone, dropped [26,171 bombs in the Middle East and North Africa](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html), up 3000 from the previous year. The countries bombed include Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, [Pakistan](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04drones.html?smid=tw-share), Libya, and [Somalia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/03/07/u-s-drone-strike-kills-more-than-150-in-somalia/?utm_term=.fbeafe46df71). 
- Began a campaign of drone assassinations in the Middle East and Africa, in which **90% of those killed were not the intended targets, but [innocent civilian bystanders](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers)**,  including women, [children](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush/), and US citizens. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_US_drone_strikes). Drone strikes are used by the military and the CIA to hunt down and kill people the [Obama administration](https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/KC_Heads01.png) has deemed — through secretive processes, without indictment or trial — worthy of execution. He authorized [10 times more drone strikes](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2017/01/17/obamas-covert-drone-war-numbers-ten-times-strikes-bush/) than George W Bush, [2](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html). The Obama assassination program is detailed in the [drone papers](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers).
- On 3 October 2015, he ordered a United States Air Force AC-130U gunship to attack the [Kunduz Trauma Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike) operated by Doctors Without Borders, in northern Afghanistan. The attack killed 42 people and wounded 30 more. The airstrike constitutes a war crime (attacks on hospitals are considered war crimes), and is the first instance of one Nobel peace prize winner (Obama) bombing and killing another (Doctors without borders). CNN and the New York Times deliberately obscured the US's responsibility for the bombing, with the headline, "US is blamed after bomb hits afghan hospital". [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike),[2](https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/cnn-and-the-nyt-are-deliberately-obscuring-who-perpetrated-the-afghan-hospital-attack/)

Two weeks later, a separate CIA drone strike in Yemen [killed his 16-year-old American-born son](http://www.salon.com/2011/10/20/the_killing_of_awlakis_16_year_old_son/), Abdulrahman, along with the boy’s 17-year-old cousin and several other innocent Yemenis. In a predictable display of bipartisanship, in January 2017, Trump ordered a SEAL strike, and reports from Yemen [quickly surfaced](http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-yemen-qaeda-idUKKBN15D094) that 30 people were killed, including 10 women and children. Among the dead: the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar Awlaki, sister of the 16 year old killed by Obama.

- Obama continued backing [Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president who helped the US fight Saddam, giving him $2B every year](https://theintercept.com/2014/10/02/feigned-american-support-egyptian-democracy-lasted-roughly-six-weeks/). After Mubarak was exposed for corruption in the 2009 Arab Spring, the US entered talks with [Suleiman, a CIA collaborator and Mubarak's vice president intelligence chief known for torturing people on behalf of the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Suleiman) The US then granted him asylum and medical treatment.
- Obama continued support for Israel and their genocide of Palestineans, leaving a parting gift of his presidency to Israel of [$38B in military aid over the next 10 years.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-statement-idUSKCN11K2CI) “Prime Minister Netanyahu and I are confident that the new MOU will make a significant contribution to Israel’s security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood,” Obama wrote.
- Finally acheived the US goal of overthrowing Gaddafi and destabilizing Libya. From 2011 onward, began conducting an extensive bombing campaign (>110 tomahawk cruise missiles) in the [Libyan Civil Wars of 2011 and 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)). This includes 7,700 air strikes, resulting in 30,000 -100,000 deaths. Loyalist towns were bombed to rubble and ethnically cleansed, and the country is in chaos as Western-trained and armed Islamist militias seize territory and oil facilities and vie for power. The Misrata militia, trained and armed by Western special forces, is one of the most violent and powerful in the world.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)) The country has since collapsed into a chaos of child soldiers, slavery, and violence between extremist groups, a haunting repetition of what US imperialism has left in its wake in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. [An interview with Gaddafi's former spokesman about the US overthrow of Libya.](https://www.rt.com/news/470321-libya-gaddafi-spokesman-interview/) When pressured, Obama stated that "not managing the aftermath of overthrowing Gaddafi" was ["the greatest mistake of his presidency."](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/barack-obama-says-libya-was-worst-mistake-of-his-presidency)
- In 2009, [Obama and Hillary Clinton assisted in the military coup of democratically elected leftist leader Zelaya of Honduras, who the US saw as a threat to US business interests](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/03/15/us-role-honduras-coup-and-subsequent-violence), [2](.https://theintercept.com/2015/07/06/clinton-honduras-coup/). [Leaked emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2157083-peanut-gallery.html) found that [Hillary was brokering a deal with the coup leaders, to ensure Zelaya would be prevented from returning to power](https://theintercept.com/2015/07/06/clinton-honduras-coup/), and Obama [blocked a proposed resolution requiring Zelaya's return](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras/pressure-mounts-on-honduras-to-end-coup-crisis-idUSN287369520090929). After the coup, at least [116 anti-US environmental activists have been murdered by the pro-US regime.](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/how-many-more/) [2](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-clinton-backed-honduran-regime-is-picking-off-indigenous-leaders/) The US now faces [massive immigration from the very same countries it destabilized](https://theconversation.com/how-us-policy-in-honduras-set-the-stage-for-todays-migration-65935), then deports them in a never-ending cycle of oppression.

#### Empowering Finance Capital

- [A leaked email revealed that the US bank Citigroup hand-picked Obama's cabinet](https://observer.com/2016/10/obama-makes-first-appearance-in-wikileaks-receives-admin-list-from-big-banker/), [2](https://twitter.com/eshaLegal/status/943235896840785925?s=20), in 2008, at the beginning of the financial crisis. 
  - Refused to prosecute any bankers or executives responsible for the 2008 crisis. His attorney general stated, ["Some banks are just too big to prosecute."](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eric-holder-banks-too-big_n_2821741)

[He approves a 117M ton expansion of coal production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlmT_UVxKNI), outraging climate activists.
- Obama went back on his campaign promise for a single-payer health care system, and removed the public option from his ACA ( a proposal mostly taken from Mitt Romney, and written by health-care industry moguls), which granted massive subsidies to empower the parasitic health insurance industry ( [~1.2 Trillion USD](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-industry-overview) ), forcing those unable to afford insurance to pay a $700 yearly fee for not having it ( called the ["shared responsibility provision"](https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/individual-shared-responsibility-provision/) ). His ACA is essentially a huge govt subsidy directly into the pockets of private health companies along with a mandate that forced people to pay these companies as well.  At least [1/4th of US workers are trapped in the gig economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/gig-economy-us-trump-uber-california-robert-reich), and many more are employed at less than full-time hours without insurance.
- [Did nothing about ballooning student loan debt ( now > $1T, an 86% increase during his tenure ), refusing to institute forgiveness programs, or allowing student loans to be discharged through bankruptcy.](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/279512-president-obamas-horrible-terrible-legacy-on-student-loans) Obama federalized the system to where the government now profits immensely from both interest on loans it makes directly to students, and defaults. [Outsourced federal student loan debt collections to private loan firms for a huge profit.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/08/debt-student-loan-forgiveness-betsy-devos-education-department-fedloan/) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/business/once-a-student-now-dogged-by-collection-agencies.html)
- Presided over the [largest foreclosure crisis in US history](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foreclosed.pdf), did nothing about it.
- The Obama era was one of the greatest decreases in working class and [black wealth](https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality), [2](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foreclosed.pdf) in history: home equity decreased by ~$17k between 2007 and 2016. His housing policies led to millions losing their homes. While Wall street banks recieved $29 Trillion in bailouts, $75 Billion in relief was set aside for housing foreclosures and mortgage assistance. Instead of being paid to families, this was paid to mortgage servicers, and the services found ways to pocket the money and continue foreclosures: by the end of the program, less than 20% of the funds were used, and most had dropped out of the program due to foreclosures. The Obama administration refused to prosecute the fraud, or any of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis.
- [Visited Flint Michigan during their lead-water poisoning crisis, to support the governor's non-response, and do damage control for the democratic party, outraging citizens.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GVv3n18_TGs) Refused to give federal aid to the city, or call a state of emergency. In a highly offensive gesture during a town hall meeting, he made light of the situation by pretending to drink the poisoned tap water. Eventually authorized FEMA to give a pithy $5M to the city, while estimates suggested that at least $100M is needed. 100k citizens, including 8-10k children have lead poisoning as a result of the state's negligence.

[His net-worth increased 3000% post-presidency.](https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-michelle-obama-net-worth-2018-7) 

#### Mass Imprisonment

- [Deported over 3M immigrants during his presidency](https://www.axios.com/immigration-ice-deportation-trump-obama-a72a0a44-540d-46bc-a671-cd65cf72f4b1.html), [2](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/biden-immigration-2020-1411691) [Deported over 400k people in 2012 alone.](https://i.imgur.com/mko2Hm6.png) Helped grow ICE, and the US mass immigrant detention system. 
  - In the present day, [ICE (U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement#Case_samples), the police tasked with immigration enforcement, operates over 500 prison camps, holding over 34,000 undocumented people deemed "aliens", 20,000 of which have no criminal convictions, in the US [system of immigration detention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States#Criticisms). [The camps](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/opinions/reyes-immigration-detention/) include forced labor (often with [contracts from private companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement#Corporate_contracts)), poor conditions, lack of rights (since the undocumented aren't considered citizens), and forced deportations, often splitting up families. Detainees are often held for a year without trial, with antiquated court procedures pushing back court dates for months, encouraging many to accept immediate deportation in the hopes of being able to return faster than the court can reach a decision, but forfeiting legal status, in a cruel system of coercion. After the creation of DHS and ICE, the budget for immigration enforcement doubled from [$6.2 billion in 2002 to $12.5 billion in 2006 under Obama.](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-enforcement-united-states-rise-formidable-machinery) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States#Criticisms), [2](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/opinions/reyes-immigration-detention/),[3](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-enforcement-united-states-rise-formidable-machinery)

- Scaled up the war on drugs, imprisoning minorities at far greater rates than ever historically. Gave no support to Black lives matter, the Ferguson protests, or the dakota access pipeline protests, allowing local authorities to brutally repress these movements.
  - The [War On Drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs), a policy of arrest and imprisonment targeting minorities, first initiated by Nixon, has over the years created a monstrous system of mass incarceration, resulting in the imprisonment of 1.5 million people each year, with the US having the most prisoners per capita of any nation. One in five black Americans will spend time behind bars due to drug laws. The war has created a permanent underclass of impoverished people who have few educational or job opportunities as a result of being punished for drug offenses, in a vicious cycle of oppression. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs#cite_note-59), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs)
  - [Obama authorizes the use of Military equipment for police.](https://www.mintpressnews.com/white-house-reauthorize-military-equipment-police/218714/)
  - Massively grew the US [prison–industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex), and the [rapid expansion of the US inmate population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate#Growth) to the political influence of [private prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison) companies and businesses that supply goods and services to government prison agencies. Such groups include corporations that contract [prison labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_labor), construction companies, [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance) technology vendors, companies that operate prison food services and medical facilities, [private probation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_probation) companies, lawyers, and [lobby groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobby_groups) that represent them. Activist groups such as the [National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_the_Reform_of_Marijuana_Laws) (NORML) have argued that the prison-industrial complex is perpetuating a flawed belief that imprisonment is an effective solution to social problems such as [homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness), [unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment), [drug addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_addiction), [mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness), and [illiteracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiteracy). [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex)
  - On April 12, 2015, [Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Freddie_Gray), a 25-year-old [Black man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_American), was [arrested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested) by the [Baltimore Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Police_Department) for possessing what the police alleged was an illegal [switchblade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade) under Baltimore law. While being transported in a [police van](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_van), several cops held him down, putting pressure on his spinal cord, after which he fell into a [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma) and died, sparking a series of [protests in Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Baltimore_protests); riot police responded violently, and called in the national guard to aid against the "thugs", as they were labeled by [Obama in a press conference](https://youtu.be/ml1LzRenH_Q). After the protests were put down, the police officers were given separate trials, and all of them were found innocent. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Freddie_Gray)

  - Since 2012, the US military has a [state-run and funded astroturfing campaign](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) to manipulate public opinion online, and spread pro-US propaganda through government funded sockpuppets, called [Operation Earnest Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice).
  - The 2010 [US diplomatic cables leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak) by Chelsea Manning revealed a pervasive policy of using US ambassadors as spies, supporting dictatorships, spying on the UN, strong-arming for US companies abroad, and disrupting nuclear disarmament talks.

  - In 2010, [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning) was imprisoned under the espionage act for a series of leaks which embarrassed the US government, including the [July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike), [Afghan War documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_War_documents_leak), [Iraq War documents leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak), [US diplomatic cables leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak), and the [Guantanamo Bay files leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_files_leak).
