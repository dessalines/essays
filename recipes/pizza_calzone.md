# Pizza or Calzone

## Dough

### Ingredients (makes 8 doughs)

- 375g or 1.5c warm water (86F/30C)
- 6g or 1 1/3tsp instant yeast
- 15g or 1 1/4Tbsp  olive oil
- 15g or 1 1/4Tbsp sugar
- 600g or 4 3/4c  bread flour
- 12g or 2tsp salt

Add ingredients to stand mixer with dough hook attachment and mix on medium speed for about 2 minutes or until the dough comes together into a shaggy ball. Increase speed to high and continue to mix for another 4 minutes or until dough is clearing the bowl.

Flip dough out onto work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces (125g each). Round into balls using method shown @1:23 . Once rounded into balls, move all 8 pieces into a lightly oiled sheet tray and cover or wrap well to prevent drying. Either refrigerate for 8-48 hours OR leave dough out at room temp for 2 hours. I recommend the 8-48 hour fridge ferment for additional dough flavor. If refrigerating, remove dough from fridge and allow to come to room temp for 1 hour.

## Pepperoni calzone

- Marinara sauce (recipe above)
- Pepperoni, sliced
- Pepperoncini’s, chopped
- Fresh mozzarella, sliced thinly (use fior di latte if you can find it)
- Full fat aged mozzarella, shredded
- Aged parmesan, grated
- Egg wash (1 egg whisked with about 10g/2 teas water)

Flour your work surface and 1 dough ball and pat down to degas. Roll ball out into about a 9”/23cm round.

Add about 3 large spoons of sauce to bottom half of dough and spread (leaving room around all edges). Add a few pinches of sliced pepperoni followed by 1-2 pinches chopped pepperoncinis. Add 2-3 slices of fresh mozzarella, a large pinch of shredded mozz, and a pinch of parm. Fold, egg wash, and bake as shown in recipe above.
